# PowerShell Deployment Script Style Guide - Tutorial Edition

## üìã Core Principles for Educational Deployments

### 1. **Learning Over Efficiency**
- Prioritize information exposure over performance optimization
- Show intermediate steps and results for educational value
- Include "What we're doing and why" explanations
- Provide detailed error context for troubleshooting skills
- Display resource relationships and dependencies

### 2. **Centralized Educational Configuration**
- Single `config.ps1` file with all settings and learning toggles
- Educational comments explaining naming patterns and constraints
- Cost awareness indicators throughout
- Variable naming that teaches Azure concepts
- Validation functions with instructional feedback

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling for Learning**
- Check `$LASTEXITCODE` after every Azure CLI call with detailed explanations
- Transform errors into learning opportunities
- Show common failure patterns and solutions
- Validate prerequisites with educational context
- Provide actionable error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### 4. **Rich Educational Feedback**
- Color-coded output with concept reinforcement
- Progress indicators with resource details
- Cost implications at decision points
- Security consideration highlights
- Intermediate value displays for understanding

### 5. **Safety and Learning Validation**
- Check resource existence with relationship explanations
- Validate tool availability with version information
- Confirm destructive operations with cost awareness
- Test connectivity with troubleshooting context

## üé® Educational Output Formatting Standards

### Enhanced Color Usage
```powershell
Write-Host "Main step descriptions" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "  Sub-actions and progress details" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "‚úì Success confirmations with details" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "üí° Learning concepts and explanations" -ForegroundColor Magenta

Write-Host "üîí Security considerations" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Warning "Non-fatal warnings with educational context"

Write-Host "‚ö†Ô∏è Resource already exists - this is normal for learning labs" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "‚ùå Operation failed - let's understand why" -ForegroundColor Red
```

## üîß Educational Configuration Patterns

### Learning Control Variables
```powershell
# =================================
# LEARNING CONFIGURATION
# =================================
$EXPLAIN_CONCEPTS = $true         # Show "What we're doing and why" sections
$SHOW_INTERMEDIATE = $true        # Display intermediate values and resource IDs
$COST_AWARENESS = $true           # Highlight cost implications throughout
$SECURITY_FOCUS = $true           # Emphasize security best practices
$TROUBLESHOOTING_MODE = $false    # Extra verbose output for debugging
```

### Educational Variable Naming with Context
```powershell
# =================================
# CORE RESOURCE NAMING
# =================================
$PROJECT_NAME = "learningtodo"        # Keep short - used in many resource names
$DISCRIMINATOR = "demo123"            # Makes resources globally unique (change this!)
$LOCATION = "East US"                 # Azure region for all resources

# Why these naming patterns?
# ‚Ä¢ Short names avoid Azure's length limits (24 chars for storage, 63 for many others)
# ‚Ä¢ Discriminator prevents conflicts when multiple people do this tutorial
# ‚Ä¢ Consistent location reduces data transfer costs and latency

# =================================
# APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE
# =================================
$RG_NAME = "$PROJECT_NAME-rg"                    # Resource Group (logical container)
$SERVICE_PLAN_NAME = "$PROJECT_NAME-plan"        # App Service Plan (compute resources)
$API_APP_NAME = "$PROJECT_NAME-api"              # Backend REST API application
$WEB_APP_NAME = "$PROJECT_NAME-web"              # Frontend web application

# Generated names with global uniqueness requirements
$API_SERVICE_NAME = "$API_APP_NAME-$DISCRIMINATOR"     # Must be globally unique
$WEB_SERVICE_NAME = "$WEB_APP_NAME-$DISCRIMINATOR"     # Must be globally unique
$DB_SERVER_NAME = "$PROJECT_NAME-sql-$DISCRIMINATOR"   # SQL Server (globally unique)
$STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME = "${PROJECT_NAME}storage$DISCRIMINATOR"  # Storage (no dashes, globally unique)

# =================================
# SERVICE CONFIGURATION WITH LEARNING CONTEXT
# =================================
$SERVICE_PLAN_SKU = "F1"              # F1 = Free tier (great for learning!)
$SQL_TIER = "Basic"                   # Basic = $5/month (cheapest paid option)
$DOTNET_VERSION = "9.0"               # Latest LTS version of .NET
$BUILD_CONFIGURATION = "Release"      # Optimized builds for deployment

# SKU Education:
# ‚Ä¢ F1 (Free): Perfect for tutorials, has limitations (60 CPU minutes/day)
# ‚Ä¢ B1 (Basic): $15/month, no daily limits, good for small projects
# ‚Ä¢ S1 (Standard): $75/month, includes staging slots and custom domains
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Educational Error Handling Patterns

### Educational Configuration Comments
```powershell
# =================================
# AZURE SQL CONFIGURATION
# =================================
$DB_SERVER_NAME = "$PROJECT_NAME-sql-$DISCRIMINATOR"  # Must be globally unique across ALL Azure
$DB_NAME = "TodoDatabase"                             # Simple name - only unique within server
$DB_ADMIN_USER = "sqladmin"                          # Admin username (avoid 'admin', 'sa', 'root')
$DB_SKU = "Basic"                                    # Basic = $5/month, good for learning
$DB_MAX_SIZE = "2GB"                                 # Basic tier allows up to 2GB

# SQL Server Naming Rules (why these constraints exist):
# ‚Ä¢ Must be globally unique (like domain names)
# ‚Ä¢ 3-63 characters, lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
# ‚Ä¢ Cannot start or end with hyphen
# ‚Ä¢ No consecutive hyphens
# This is why we use the discriminator pattern!

# Security Note:
# In production, never put passwords in config files
# We'll use Azure Key Vault and Managed Identity instead
```
