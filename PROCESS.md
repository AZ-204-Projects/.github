# Personal Process and Conventions

This document outlines my workflow, conventions, and reminders for all projects in AZ-204-Projects.

## General Conventions
- Every repo must have a clear `README.md` stating its purpose.
- Document names of actual Azure resources used/tested.
- List step-by-step procedures for resource creation and deletion.

## Completion Checklist
- Summarize key memorable facts at the end of each project.
- Create Anki cards for major concepts or tricky steps.
- Record and execute a cleanup process to avoid resource sprawl.

## Additional Notes
- Use consistent naming conventions for repos and resources.
- Reference this doc when starting a new project.
